# Intro_to_R_2022
Exercise material and slides for the Evomics Workshop on Genomics Introduction to R.

This is the material from 2020 for modifications.
You can edit the Rmd slides in RStudio and compile the html presentation from there. It relies on reveal.js (https://revealjs.com/) and in order to complite it, you might need to run 'install.packages("revealjs")'. See also https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs.
